# UART in VHDL

This repository contains a VHDL implementation of an RS232 communication controller.

It was developed in 2008 and used in various projects on two FPGA boards: the [Xilinx Spartan-3E Starter Kit](http://www.digilentinc.com/S3EBOARD/) and the [XUP Virtex-II Pro](http://www.digilentinc.com/xupv2p/) board.

All pin specifications in `uart_test.ucf` are for the Spartan-3E board.

## Default communication settings
115200 bps transfer rate, 8 data bits, no parity
